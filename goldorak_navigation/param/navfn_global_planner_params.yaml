NavfnROS:
  visualize_potential: false  # false - Publish potential for rviz as pointcloud2, not really helpful

  allow_unknown: false  # true
  # Specifies whether or not to allow navfn to create plans that traverse unknown space
  # Needs to have track_unknown_space: true in the obstacle / voxel layer (in costmap_commons_param) to work

  planner_window_x: 0.0  # 0.0 - Specifies the x size of an optional window to restrict the planner to
  planner_window_y: 0.0  # 0.0 - Specifies the y size of an optional window to restrict the planner to

  default_tolerance: 0.0  # 0.0
  # If the goal is in an obstacle, the planer will plan to the nearest point in the radius of default_tolerance
  # The area is always searched, so could be slow for big values
